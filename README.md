## Brief 
To create a service-orientated architecture for an application, this application must be composed of at least 4 services that work together

* Service #1 The core service –  Renders Jinja2 templates to interact with the application, it will be responsible for communicating with the other 3 services, and finally for persisting some data in an SQL database.

* Service #2 + #3 - These will both generate a random “Object”

* Service #4 - This service will also create an “Object” however this “Object” must be based upon the results of service #2 + #3 using some pre-defined rules.

For services #2, #3 and #4 you need to create 2 different implementations, must be able to demonstrate swapping these implementations out for each other seamlessly, without disrupting the user experience.


### Additional Requirements
* An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
    * **Technology used : Trello**

* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
    * **Technology used : GIT**

* If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
    *   **Technology used : Githubs integrated webhooks settings** 

* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
    *   **Approach used : 4 services including an application core were used** 

* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
    * **Container tool used : Docker**

    * **Container - orchestration tools used :**
        * **Docker-Compose**  
        * **Docker-Swarm** 
        * **Docker-Stack**

* As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
    * **Technology used : Ansible**

* The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.
     * **Technology used : NGINX**

### Deliverable 

* The final deliverable for this project is a completed CI Pipeline with full documentation around the utilisation of supporting tools.
* The CI Pipeline needs to be able to successfully deploy the application you have created as per the requirements.


### My Approach

My ideal approach would have been to have the CI/CD system in place at least end to end in some working form. As projects develop there are always going to be changes to how the pipeline functions, this is inevitable as applications change over time. However having end to end function from development to delivery at the beginning of development , reduces the time to market for the application.
Due to time constraints and not having been taught the entirety of the material at the point of inception of the project . It was neccessary to parallelize the development of the application and the CI/CD pipeline.
Shortly after the CI/CD material was comprehended , I was able to focus on the CI/CD pipeline. Once the Infrastructure was complete, development on the application became much more streamlined in terms of effectivly dealing with errors and debugging.
